               <p>Technological advances in the electronics industry continue to revolutionize communication and access to information like never before. The companies that design and produce the devices that keep people connected are some of the most profitable and valuable in the world. Industry behemoths such as Apple, Samsung and IBM are some of the most recognizable brands, but many less-familiar companies are experiencing rapid growth under the radar, or by simply riding the coattails of the top companies. Often, they take part in white label production practices.
