        <p>The multimedia software can be found in the various fields of creative industries, entertainment, medicine, business, and the list goes on.

        The creative industries have the most demand for professionals skilled in multimedia. An individual with special skills in multimedia can cater to a wide range of industries’ needs. The commercial use of the multimedia ranges from advertising to graphic designing as it helps the presenter in capturing the attention of his client. The use of multimedia to point across one’s point really helps in making sure that the message is well received and understood. Let’s not forget the really funny or the really moving advertisement that we saw on the T.V. or the really great sci-fi movie that you saw, all of it is multimedia at its best. The video games that we have all played in the childhood are again, nothing but a great graphic designer at work.</p><br>

        <p>There is a variety of multimedia software available for free for the use of the public in general and the professionals as well. While some of these multimedia software that can be used in your phones as well in the form of apps, whereas some other software is only limited to your laptops. But nonetheless, the software is the best that you can have for your needs. Few of the software that is available is as follows:</p><br>

      
        <h2><b>Picasa</b></h2>
        <p>Picasa is excellent multimedia related software for the viewing, organizing, and editing of the pictures in your laptop. While providing all these services, one other service given provided by this software is that you can create an album of your own digital pictures and share them with your loved ones as well. Originally created by the Lifescape Company, it was later on bought by Google and hence was provided for free. The software of Picasa was originally devised for Windows XP, Vista, 7 and Mac OS X only. But later on google teamed up with Wine to make the software available for Linux as well. However the Linux versions of the software of so out of date that it might not include many of the special features of the multimedia software.</p><br>

          <h2><b>VLC media player</b></h2>
         <p>The VLC media player as the name suggests is the platform where you can play your videos and audios for free. This was developed by a company named VideoLAN project. The VLC is not only limited to your laptops and desktops and MacBook but can also be used in your android phone, windows phone, iPad, iPhone, and iPod for free and can be downloaded easily from the app store of your respective device. And that is not it about the much talked about media player, the media player can support all kinds of formats of the audio and the video. So you don’t have to worry if your video is not a particular format because you can, in any case, play it in the VLC media player without much of a hassle.</p><br>
         <p>And the best part about this VLC multimedia software is that it is absolutely free. That means you can download it for free without having to get into all the complications of the trial version of it. And the latest version of this software has got some amazing features such as it can auto-rotate the video that had been shot at weird angle or if you happen to stop a video in the middle, then the next time you play, you won’t have to start from the beginning and it can just resume your video from where you left. You can also very easily add subtitles to your video, all you have to do is add an SRT file to the folder where your video is saved and the next time you play the video, you will also have subtitles along with it.</p><br>

           <h2><b>Windows movie maker</b></h2>
           <p>Windows movie maker is the software for the people who love to edit their videos. This was developed by the Microsoft Company under the name of Sundance. Being a part of the windows essential multimedia software, this software not only helps in making and editing the video but also allows you to publish those videos on OneDrive, Facebook, and YouTube etc.<br>

            The editing of the video in the software is fairly easy. You can place the video to be edited anywhere on the timeline and then split it, duplicate or reposition it as per your liking. Also, there are some pre-defined editing styles included in the software which helps you to make your video all the more attractive and interesting. But if you worry that the multimedia software windows will modify your original video then there is no need to worry. The video editing software will only create a duplicate of the original video along with the changes that you put in, keeping the original video unharmed and unchanged. This not only saves your video from being damaged but also helps you create various different versions of the same video as per your liking.<br>

          The earlier versions of the software did not give you the liberty of saving the file in the profile of your desire and you could only export the video in some pre-defined format. But now that problem has also been solved and now you can save the video in whatever format as you wish.</p><br>

              <h2><b>Adobe Photoshop</b></h2>
              <p>Adobe Photoshop was developed by the adobe systems for the raster graphics editing designed for the windows system and the Mac OS. The software has created a niche for itself in the editing world. The word Photoshop has created a place for itself and is now even used a verb many times. It is one of its kind software and is able to edit raster images using multiple layers. The multimedia software not only supports various graphics file formats but it also has its own file format under the name of PSB and PSD and also supports all the features mentioned above. Although the Photoshop itself supports many features besides the raster graphics such as the vector graphics, 3D graphics, and video if the editor wants then he can expand the purview of the features offered by the software by installing the Photoshop plug-ins. These have been developed independently of Photoshop and also distributed independently but can work effectively well in the main Photoshop software and offer a whole new range of features for the software and the editor.<br>
              Earlier the naming of the various versions of the software were based on the number but in October 2002, the system changed due to the introduction of creative suit and hence the new versions of Photoshop were assigned the abbreviation of CS along with a numerical number such as Photoshop CS, Photoshop CS1, Photoshop CS2 and so on. Other than that, the versions from CS3 to CS6 also had different editions namely standard and extended edition.<br>
             </p><br>
        

                <h2><b>Media Monkey</b></h2>
                <p>Developed by Ventis Media Inc., the software was developed for the organization and playing of the audio of the windows operating system. But by adding various plug-in available, the MediaMonkey software can also be used to view and handle various videos and other media formats available. Although the basic software is a free multimedia software or as it is generally called, as freeware but if you want some additional features in the software such as the ability to handle various multiple media and automatic organization of the files then you will have to pay extra for the premium gold license. But other than that, both the editions of the software are strikingly similar such as the skin options offered and the third-party plug-in option available to extend the use of the software.<br>

                The editing of the audio files helps the user in changing the format of the audio file into the format most accepted. It also helps in burning the files on the CD and if the need is then the user can also lower the volume level of the audio according to his wish. And the software also supports various music formats such as the MP3, AAC, OGG, WMA, MPC, WAV, FLAC, and APE. The volume level of the audio can also be easily adjusted by the use of plug-ins called ReplayGain and MP3Gain.</p><br>
                  
                  <h2><b>Inkscape</b></h2>
                <p>Inkscape is a software so as to be able create as well as edit the vector images including the illustrations, the logos, the complex paintings, the diagrams etc. one unique feature about Inkscape is that while it can support the images of various formats but the work of editing the images occur under the graphics format od Scalable Vector Graphics or better known as SVG.<br>
                Under this software, you can create your own images and shapes under the SVG format. Also, these created shapes can be further subjected to editing and transformation and can also be given various movements such as rotating, scaling, moving etc. it also helps the editor to create vector graphic from various sources such as the photos as it supports the function of image tracing. It is often argued that if Inkscape is better or adobe illustrator. Hence to clear that point, the Inkscape software can do almost all the things that an editor can do in illustrator. Although under different names and different heads, but the Inkscape software is equipped with all the tools that are present in the adobe illustrator. Although there is a certain list of things that the illustrator can do such as the multiple strokes and fills for one object, natively work with graphs based on data, which the Inkscape cannot perform. But there are certainly some functions that the inkscape can perform but the illustrator cannot perform like editing the SVG source directly, edit notes with keyboard etc.</p><br>
