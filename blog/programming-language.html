        <p>The most important skill to learn in today’s world is to know how to write a computer program. Today, computers have entered in almost every industry. Be it the autopilot in an aircraft or digital speedometer in your bike, computers in various forms surround us. Computers are extremely useful for an organization to scale up well. Gone are the days of pen and paper. Today, in order to store and access your information, you absolutely need computers.</p>
        <p>The programming and developer communities are emerging at a rate faster than ever before. Various new programming languages are coming up that are suited for different categories of developers (beginners, intermediate, and experts) as well as for different use cases (web application, mobile applications, game development, distributed system, etc).</p><br>

        <h2><b>1. Python</b></h2>
        <p>Python undoubtedly tops the list. It is widely accepted as the best programming language to learn first. Python is fast, easy-to-use, and easy-to-deploy programming language that is being widely used to develop scalable web applications. YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey are all built-in Python. Python provides excellent library support and has a large developer community. The programming language provides a great starting point for beginners. Talking about those who are looking for a better job, you should definitely learn Python ASAP! A lot of startups are using Python as their primary backend stack.</p><br>
            <p><img src="../img/Python.jpg"style="width: 80%;height: 200px;"></p><br>

          <h2><b>2. Java</b></h2>
         <p>Java is another popular choice in large organizations and it has remained so for decades. Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale web applications. Java is known to be extremely stable and so, many large enterprises have adopted it. If you are looking for a development based job at a large organization, Java is the language that you should learn. Java is also widely used in Android App Development. Almost any business today needs an Android Application owing to the fact that there are billions of Android users today. This opens up a huge opportunity for Java developers given the fact that Google has created an excellent Java-based Android development framework - Android Studio.</p><br>
              

           <h2><b>3. C/C++</b></h2>
           <p>C/C++ is like the bread and butter of programming. Almost all low-level systems such as operating systems, file systems, etc are written in C/C++. If you wish to be a system-level programmer, C/C++ is the language you should learn. C++ is also widely used by competitive programmers owing to the fact that it is extremely fast and stable. C++ also provides something called STL - Standard Template Library. STL is a pool of ready-to-use libraries for various data structures, arithmetic operations, and algorithms. The library support and speed of the language make it a popular choice in the High-frequency trading community as well.</p><br>
                 <p><img src="../img/cpro.png"style="width: 80%;height: 200px;"></p><br>

              <h2><b>4. JavaScript</b></h2>
              <p>JavaScript is the “frontend” programming language. JavaScript is widely used to design interactive frontend applications. For instance, when you click on a button which opens up a popup, the logic is implemented via JavaScript.
              These days, many organizations, particularly startups, are using NodeJS which is a JavaScript-based run-time environment. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Hence now with JS, you can use a single programming language for server-side and client-side scripts. If you are looking for that cool tech job at your favorite startup, you should seriously consider learning JavaScript.</p><br>
                   <p><img src="../img/js.png"style="width: 80%;height: 200px;"></p><br>

                <h2><b>5. Go programming language</b></h2>
                <p>Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language built by Google. Go provides excellent support for multithreading and so, it is being used by a lot of companies that rely heavily on distributed systems. Go is widely used in startups in Silicon Valley. However, it is yet to be adopted by Indian companies/startups. Those who wish to join a Valley-based startup specializing in core systems should master Golang.</p><br>

                  
                  <h2><b>6. R</b></h2>
                <p>R programming language is one of the most commonly used programming languages for Data Analysis and Machine Learning. R provides an excellent framework and built-in libraries to develop powerful Machine Learning algorithms. R is also used for general statistical computing as well as graphics. R has been well adopted by enterprises. Those who wish to join “Analytics” team of a large organization should definitely learn R.</p><br>
               

                  <h2><b>7. Swift</b></h2>
                <p>Swift is the programming language that is used to develop iOS applications. iOS-based devices are becoming increasingly popular. Apple iPhone, for instance, has captured a significant market share and is giving a tough competition to Android. Therefore, those who want to serve this community can learn Swift programming.</p><br>
                     

                  <h2><b>8. PHP</b></h2>
                <p>PHP is among the most popular backend programming language. Though PHP is facing tough competition from Python and JavaScript, the market still needs a large number of PHP developers. Those who wish to join a reasonably well old organization as a backend developer should aim to learn PHP programming.<br>
                Abundance of powerful frameworks.<b>pros</b><br>
                   Easy to get started for making web pages,
                  First-class debugging with Xdebug,

                      <p><img src="../img/php.png"style="width: 80%;height: 200px;"></p><br>

                  <h2><b>9. C#</b></h2>
                <p>C# is a general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. C# is widely used for backend programming, building games (using Unity), building Window mobile phone apps and lots of other use cases.<b>pros:</b><br>
                    As pointer types aren’t permitted, much safer than C and C++,
                    Automatic scalable and updateable,
                    Component-oriented, object-oriented programming language,
                    Follows a syntax similar to the C programming language,
                   Fully integrated with the .NET library,
                  Ideal for all types of Windows development,
                Rich sets of library functions and data types,
              Supports type safety,

                         <p><img src="../img/cc.png"style="width: 80%;height: 200px;"></p><br>

                      <h2><b>10. MATLAB</b></h2>
                <p>MATLAB is a statistical analysis tool that is used in various industries for Data Analysis. MATLAB is used widely in the Computer Vision and Image processing industry as well.<b>pros:</b><br>
                      Eases developing scientific simulation thanks to a rich inbuilt library,
                    Functionality can be extended greatly by adding toolboxes,
                    High coding efficiency and productivity as it doesn’t require a compiler for execution,
                    Ideal for developing scientific research applications,
                    Matlab Coder allows converting code for using in other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python
                    Platform-independent</p>
